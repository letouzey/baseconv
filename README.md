Base Conversion of Integers
===========================

We propose here an encoding of natural numbers in base 10 (or 16)
for easy parsing and printing. Then we provide conversion functions
between these base-10 and base-16 numbers and Coq usual numerical
datatypes (nat, N, positive, Z, ...) and we prove the correctness
of these conversion functions.
